    "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this guest review and assign scores between 0 and 10 for each of the specified areas. Let me start by understanding what each area entails.\n\nFirst, the guest mentions that the cruise overall was great except for a few hiccups. So, the ship overall should be rated high, maybe around 8 or 9 because it's described as great despite some issues.\n\nNext, the guest talks about the rooms. They don't mention anything specific about the rooms, so I think that would be 'n/a' since there's no information provided.\n\nMoving on to F&B quality overall. The guest didn't comment on food or beverage quality, so that's also 'n/a'.\n\nF&B service overall is another area. Again, the guest doesn't mention any issues with service, so it should be 'n/a'.\n\nThe main dining experience isn't discussed either, so that's 'n/a'.\n\nEntertainment is another category. The guest didn't talk about entertainment, so that's also 'n/a'.\n\nExcursions are mentioned as being expensive. The guest paid \u00a325 five years ago and now it's \u00a396, which is a significant increase. They also suggest looking for a different company next year because Marella seems to be stuck in certain regions. So, the excursion cost and limited options might affect the score. I think this would rate around 5 or 6 because while they acknowledge the expense, they still had some issues.\n\nPrimary issues mentioned include the high cost of excursions and the difficulty in booking a table for their anniversary. The friend couldn't book a table of 8; only 6 were possible, leading to having to go to Surf and Turf twice and sitting separately. This seems like a significant issue affecting their experience. So, primary issues would be around 7 or 8 because it's a notable problem but not the worst.\n\nLastly, sentiment analysis. The guest starts by saying the cruise was great, which is positive. However, they mention several issues, so the overall sentiment might lean slightly negative. I think this would rate around 6 or 7 because while there are positives, the negatives bring it down a bit.\n\nI should make sure each area is scored appropriately based on the information given and that 'n/a' is assigned where there's no mention.\n</think>\n\n",

    "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this guest review and assign scores from 0 to 10 for each of the specified areas. Let me start by reading through the review carefully.\n\nThe guest mentions that the cruise was fantastic with many ports of call, which is a positive point. They also talk about the islands being beautiful and booked trips for all of them, indicating satisfaction with the destinations. The US immigration process was a pain but worth it, so maybe that's a minor issue but overall positive.\n\nThey've taken five Marella cruises before and enjoyed them all, which suggests they have a good experience with the cruise line. They praise the trip in general, ports of call, and excursions booked through Narella as fantastic without any faults. The staff, from cabin stewards to bar staff and even the captain, made them feel welcome and were always happy and helpful. That's a strong positive for service.\n\nThe entertainment shows in the evening were also fantastic, so that's another positive aspect. They can't wait to book their next cruise, which is a great sign of satisfaction.\n\nNow, I need to assign scores based on these points. Let me go through each category:\n\n1. **Ship Overall**: The guest didn't mention any issues with the ship itself, just the ports and staff. So maybe around 9 since they had no complaints but also didn't highlight the ship's features.\n\n2. **Ship Rooms**: Again, no specific mentions about rooms, so probably a high score like 8-9 because they didn't fault them.\n\n3. **F&B Quality Overall**: They didn't mention food or beverage quality, so maybe 7-8 since it's not a focus but also not criticized.\n\n4. **F&B Service Overall**: The staff in F&B areas was good, so around 9.\n\n5. **F&B Quality Main Dining**: No specific mention, so maybe 7-8.\n\n6. **Entertainment**: They praised the shows and entertainment, so that's a solid 9.\n\n7. **Excursions**: They booked excursions through Narella and found them fantastic, so 10.\n\n8. **Primary Issues Mentioned**: The only issue was US immigration, which was a pain but they felt it was worth it. So maybe 5 since it was an inconvenience but not a major problem with the cruise itself.\n\n9. **Sentiment Analysis**: Overall, the guest had a very positive experience, so sentiment is extremely positive. Maybe 10.\n\nI should make sure each area not mentioned by the guest gets 'n/a'. Let me check if I missed any areas. The review doesn't mention F&B quality in main dining or primary issues beyond immigration, so those are covered.\n</think>\n\n",

    "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this guest review and assign scores from 0 to 10 across several categories. Let me start by reading through the review carefully.\n\nThe guest mentions that overall, it was a great itinerary with fantastic service, especially in the main restaurant. So that's positive for both ship overall and F&B service. They also talk about the shows being very good but question the costumes, which might be a minor issue. \n\nNext, they praise the main restaurant upgrades as excellent and cabins as clean and comfortable. The chairs in the glasshouse are called atrocious, but it's noted as a minor point. So that's a negative for ship rooms.\n\nThe crew is amazing, so F&B service gets another positive. Entertainment is also good. Food was OK but could improve, except for specialty restaurants which were excellent. So F&B quality main dining is average, and overall F&B quality might be slightly lower because of the need for improvement in regular dining.\n\nUpgrades to cabins are 5-star, especially showers, so ship rooms get a higher score there. They didn't mention any primary issues beyond the chairs, so that's a minor point.\n\nSentiment analysis: The guest had some negatives but overall positive, so sentiment is positive.\n</think>\n\n",
